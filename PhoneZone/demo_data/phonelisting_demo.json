I had had this phone before so I knew it was a good performing phone. Nothing fancy but nice touch screen which locks easy & prevents butt calling. Also full size keyboard for texting. I bought the LAST one from the supplier out of FL. It said refurbished but came in original box & looked new. We just swapped out SIM card & it's working fine! A little pricey at $60, but better than free ones at store!! I would also recommend the LG Vu, I've had it before, if you want a basic phone."

It's reception and functions (especially if you change menu to Google) are great. It is a great value for someone who has to bring their own phone. It looks nice, it's much lighter than other phones but the metal case makes it look pricier. I love the fingerprint unlock. It's location makes perfect sense. When I bought it (in the beginning of the year) I spent hours reading reviews and watching reviews.It was one of the best rated in March 2016 for it's price range. I have not been disappointed."

It is fast, it takes excellent pics, and has a great screen display. Bigger than my S4 for sure. I love it and will buy it again. If you want a quality phone without the expensive price tag, it's a no brainer."

When I came back to Verzion, I wanted a second line but not the expense of a new phone and was pleased to see that an Alias was a possibility. The battery life is incredible - much better than I remembered and far more than any recent phones I've had. It is a thin, light phone with a two-way flip: one like a normal flip phone, the other similar to a micro-laptop for web surfing (such that it is). Web access is a drawback, due to no fault of the phone. The internet software is no longer supported by Verizon and many web-based features (games, new ringtones, music download, etc) is disables. The very simple web browser still works to date and many sites are still accessible. Another couple minor annoyances: the ring volume is very soft and there is no wi-fi. But it is a very attractive phone and still gets comments; it's surprisingly rugged for a dual-hinge phone and the call quality is superb. In many ways the Alias outperforms newer phones. I'll hang on to this one much longer this time!"

The only issue was the small size of the Querty keyboard and the smaller screen than what I expected. But the phone was in mint condition. A person with small hands and good eye sight, it's the flip/txt phone for you! I like the idea that it opens two ways for talking and texting versus the slider phones on the market today."

We travel to Israel regularly as our daughter lives there and decided it would be cheapest to own a phone that we can just buy a Sim card for while there. We figured we could also use it if we travel to other countries. The phone basically worked fine for calls and texting. Nothing fancy. It is not a smart phone, which we knew. It was easy enough to figure out how to use it. Was not crazy about the sound clarity. Would not like it for my regular phone but good if you want a phone for just travel use. Did not want to spend the money for an unlocked smart phone but did miss having one at times to look up things as we were traveling. The phone supposedly had some internet access but I could never access it."

The EMUI software takes getting used too, but using a launcher such as Nova fixes most of the gripes people have with this phone.This phone feels like it should be double it's price. Good job Huawei!"

The sound/speakers work fine with everything EXCEPT when it comes to notifying me of incoming calls/texts/etc. Oh sure, the alarm works when I need to get up in the morning for work, and for playing podcasts, videos, and music. But what's the point of a phone when a call or text comes in and I have NO idea? Horribly inconvenient. I didn't buy this phone for fun, I need it to COMMUNICATE. This is my first Apple device and truly the biggest regret I've ever purchased. If only my financial situation allowed me to make this right - to buy a new/better phone - but, dang. I'm screwed over and there's not much I can do about it. Thanks Apple."

The design and build quality of this phone makes the jet black iphone look ordinary and the battery life makes the iphone look pathetic. I don't mind the EMUI that much, but am a real fan of Google Now, so went straight to that launcher. The settup was pretty easy, though it did not simply mirror my apps and settings from my other phone, so I had to download and install my favorite apps one at a time. Since the phone is so fast, that did not take much time and it gave me the chance to explore settings and features while I was doing the tasks. Camera results are superb though I have much more to learn about the options and features provided. Signal strength for both wifi and network are the best I've had in my rural local. So far I'm totally pleased with this item and found a case I really like, though I'd much rather use the phone without a case. That is not, however, a practical every day option. Drops could be fatal with so much glass exposed. I'll update more here if I change my point of view, but for now this is a winning choice for my needs and taste."

        "comment": "The Honor 8, beautiful phone in my opinion. It is almost perfect but it's not. There are some technical and physical cons that I'd like to address but first, let's start with the pros.Pros-Gorgeous design. I really like the design of this phone, it's elegant and eye-catching.-Performace, it's really snappy. I love how quick everything loads.-Display, even though I would prefer an AMOLED display, this display is pretty good and can hold it's ground.-Battery Life, it would last my a day and a half of regular use (so mix of youtube, texting, gaming, taking pictures, etc.)-The camera can take amazing pictures but there is a downside.-The phone feels extremely solid in the hand.-Fast charging charges the phone up in about 1 and a half hours.Neutral-EMUI, I personally don't hate it but I wish they would stick with a more traditional android experience. It, however, is annoying that notifications don't show up on the lock screen.Cons-The camera's video capabilities aren't the greatest. It's decent but not great.-This phone uses Gorilla Glass 3 not 4. I wished Huawei would put this in the spec sheet on their website. I had to go ask an agent from Huawei in order to get this information.-I wish this phone uses quick charge 3.0 because there isn't any quick charge battery banks that support this phone which is disappointing.-For me, the GPS is gimmicky when I'm using it for the first few minutes but the problem goes away after those few minutes.-The phone only has 24.06 GB of storage even though it's advertised as 32 GB.Overall, the phone is great. For $322.98, it's a great deal. I got it on Black Friday for $265 with the free Doctor Strange bundle (case is pretty sick). I would recommend this phone to anyone that's looking for an amazing budget phone."

        "comment": "This phone is absolutely fantastic for the price, but some potential buyers may not be fully aware of what to expect when it arrives.First off this phone is actually an unlocked AT&T Lumia 900, so there will be AT&T branding on the front. This means that the original packaging will already be opened, as the seller needs to manually unlock the phone before they ship it to you. This does NOT mean that it is a used phone. In order to be able to use non-AT&T sim cards, it is necessary for the seller to contact AT&T to receive an unlock code that frees it from the AT&T network. In my order, there was hardly any sign that it was handled at all, except for maybe a little finger print on the front glass. All the essential documents from AT&T and Nokia were inside the box, as well as a SIM ejector tool and a power cable.As is stated in the description, this phone will work on any HSPA/WCDMA 850/900/1900/2100 MHz/Quad-band data network and any GSM/GPRS/EDGE: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz cellular network, which in turn opens it for carriers in Europe and some in Asia. For US providers, there are currently only 2 major carriers that have GSM networks: AT&T and T-Mobile. There are other smaller carriers that offer services, but they utilize AT&T and T-Mobile towers in their coverage. These carriers include Straight Talk, Red Pocket Mobile, i Wireless, etc., and offer really affordable prepaid plans that I myself utilize. T-Mobile also offers a $30 a month prepaid plan that is rather reasonable.Unfortunately this phone will not work on any CDMA networks, which rules out Verizon, Sprint and US Cellular. For more information on the differences between CDMA and GSM networks, PCMAG.com has a fairly easy to read article explaining the differences between the two.Now onto the phone itself. I must say that I love this phone. It has a fairly decent Amoled 4.3 inch display, with a resolution of only 800x480. In our modern age of 1280\u00d7720 and above screens that may seem rather paltry. While using the phone normally it is looks as good as any other screen, but when watching YouTube videos it's lack of pixels becomes apparent. For me I use my iPad and laptop for watching videos so it doesn't matter to me all that much, but for others it may be a deal breaker.The build of the phone is absolutely fantastic. It is made of a solid polycarbonate body that is very resistant to scratches, with a screen made of Corning Gorilla Glass. Needless to say, it is very sturdy. The screen also seems to attract a large number of fingerprints as well, and for some reason is not all that easy to clean off. There is even a YouTube video where a hammer, saw and nail are taken to it and it comes up with little or no damage. The only thing on the phone that seems to be somewhat damageable is the metal piece around the camera lens. After less than 24 hours, there were already little scratches visible. For me I don't really care too much about it, but for others it may be really irritating.The camera itself is 8 megapixels with a Carl Zeiss lens, and it is just ok. There are certainly better phone cameras out there, with the iPhone 5 and Lumia 920 blowing it out of the water. For me it works best outdoors, as indoor shots tend to have more noise for whatever reason.This phone uses Windows Phone 7.5 Mango, so it is not the brand new Windows Phone 8. Sad thing about this phone is that it will never receive an update to Windows Phone 8. The hardware is just unable to fully handle the new OS. Instead it will receive Windows Phone 7.8, which gives it some Windows Phone 8 functionality, such as resizable tiles and the like. But apps in the future will cater just to Windows Phone 8, meaning that those with 7.8 and below will be left out in the cold with newer apps. Again, this isn't a deal breaker for me but for many it will be.One of the things that attracted me to this phone is Nokia Drive. Unlike most smartphone map applications, it does not require data in order to run. Before you set out on a trip you download fully detailed maps onto your phone, and then the built in GPS chip is used to map your location on the map. You can even download state or country specific maps, so you save space by not downloading the entire US map pack. All of this is done without data usage, which is great if you are traveling abroad. Oh, and it is completely free of charge. For travelers like myself, this is an awesome feature. I am also a student, so having a mobile version of Microsoft Office in my pocket is absolutely wonderful, for it allows me to edit documents while on the go.Overall this is a fantastic phone but definitely shows its age (close to one year). However, its awesome build quality as well as fantastic applications for travelers made it a must have for me. It fits my needs well, but potential buyers will need to consider whether it will work well for them."

That may be true but I adjusted the settings to 200 for the ISO and 1 for the exposure and the pictures have improved greatly. The simplicity of this phone makes it easy to learn and pick up for anyone. Its a breeze finding things on this phone, no lag, great UI. The live tiles are easy to use and multi-task through. And this phone is blazing fast! enough said."

The phone was completely dead when I got it and has finally come on so I know it at least works how well I'm not sure as I am waiting for it to charge completely. It did not come in a box like they said but that's ok I already have an iPhone box as I bought mine new for $1.06 when I signed on to my 3 year contract. At that time the phones had just come out. Ill update my listing once I mess with the phone. There were light scratches on the back but nothing gastly just normal wear."

The current OS is heavily customised by Huawei and it runs slower than my galaxy S2 from the stone age, my experia Z from the stone age is also better than this, and my zte zmax first gen runs circles around the honor 5x, what were you thinking Huawei???? what, wasted that hardware on poor software, not a smart move."

The phone would die completely if the phone's battery reached half-life. I contact the company to get a battery. Living overseas it is not easy replacing a battery for this model and when I purchased it I thought I was purchasing a \"working\" iphone. That was four months ago with no response from the company. Last week the phone did one better, it stopped charging completely and the touch screen literally exploded from the inside out. Although this phone has been in a draw in a protective case for a month when my son was no longer grounded we gave it back to him the touch screen as completely disconnected itself from the phone while the body of the phone was still in the protective case. My son tried to press the screen back into the body of the phone and then the screen cracked. This was a waste of money and time he never got a full months use out of the thing, we were better off just buying him a cheap prepaid phone at least it would have worked."

I found this out when I tried to have a prepaid service turned on and shelled out $60 for a chip that was nonrefundable. I was furious, I expected the worst to try and resolve this issue, but when I emailed him on Friday night about 6 pm western time he responded within 20 minutes. He apologized profusely and talked me through how to finish the unlock and update til 11:30. then when I installed my new chip it works fine and has been fine ever since I would definitely recommend and buy from this seller again. Things happen and he stood behind his product well past regular business hours."

So, there will be times when you can't turn on the phone and cannot make a phone call. If you are in an emergency, you won't be able to reach anyone and you may die because of that. The phone, when it can be turned on, takes FOREVER to load a webpage. The touch screen is not sensitive. The battery needs to be recharged every day even if you don't use the phone. You will have many dropped calls. When the phone thinks you have talked enough, it will cut off your conversation and you have to call again to continue your conversation. Language input methods includes only English and Spanish. The picture of the phone on Amazon doesn't show the back of the phone. I thought it was all silver, but the back of the phone is white. The earphones broke within a week. These are enough reasons for you to not buy this phone. I have had enough and decided to write a review on it."

I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully. If not, it's either just not meant for me, I got a lemon, or I should just curse the fact that I have big fingers. Lol."

        "comment": "So I'm kind of a gear nut, in the last 2 years I've gone through: HTC One M8, One Plus One, LG G4, Nexus 6P and now the Huawei Honor 8. My first foray into the Huawei product line was the 6P and honestly I was pretty impressed at what has been coming out of China with regards to affordable Android Devices.Let's get one thing straight, this is an iPhone 6 rip off ALL DAY LONG. From the design of the phone, to the look and feel of the OS, this thing stops just short of saying iPhone on the back. That said, the design is super clean, the back glass looks amazing and the phone is quite the little performer. I've been using this as my daily driver and the performance of the camera is really what sets this device apart from the other phones I've carried. The quality of images in good lighting conditions is phenomenal, especially when I consider I only paid $350 for the phone. Applications are snappy and function just as well as on my Nexus 6P, although I don't game much so YMMV. You can find reviews all over YouTube for this phone that will tout all the goods and bads, and I will say there are some weaknesses, lack of T-Mobile WiFi support is my only real disappointment!Battery life is great, especially for a 5 inch phone. The included quick works great, although it would have been awesome if it supported Qualcomm quick charging! Fingerprint sensor is actually faster and more responsive than my Nexus 6P and my wife's iPhones 6 & 7. If you're looking for an inexpensive 5 inch phone that has an amazing camera and performs well, check out the Honor 8."

This phone gets 4-6 hours SOT.Nice screen.Great updates so far. On the 9/1/16 security patch as of mid-October, with 2 OTA updates in past 3 weeks.USB-C is much nicer ergonomically than microUSB.Works out of the box with Cricket and Straight Talk.Only downside right now is limited case availability. None from major case vendors right now. Using the OEM clear case, which is too minimalist for my tendency to drop the phone every now and then."

I learned you have to mess with the battery settings when you get it out the box. Not a big deal at all. The pictures this phone takes are amazing. Gives you the boken effect experience that the Iphone 7 Plus promises with a update."

        "comment": "Tengo una semana de estar utilizando este tel\u00e9fono celular. Es mi primer Nokia y al principio fue un poco frustrante por que no sab\u00eda donde buscar las aplicaciones, yo estaba acostumbrado a los celulares Sony Ericksson y me sent\u00eda muy c\u00f3modo con ellos pero por las caracter\u00edsticas que presentaba el N97 su gran cantidad de memoria ser de tecnolog\u00eda 3G, los buenos comentarios que hab\u00eda escuchado y por precio decid\u00ed comprarlo en lugar de un Sony Ericksson.Como mencion\u00e9 al principio me frustr\u00e9 pero era mas por desconocimiento que otra cosa por ejemplo le instal\u00e9 el navegador Opra mini ya que el navegador que el trae no me gustaba pero cuando me conectaba a Internet lo hac\u00eda atravez del navegador predeterminado y yo no sab\u00eda que ten\u00eda que entrar a aplicaciones y de ah\u00ed accesar a Opra. Pero poco a poco fui encontrandole las aplicaciones y debo decir que ahora estoy muy contento.Las cosas buenas de este celular:1) Esteticamente es muy lindo, la resoluci\u00f3n de la pantalla hace que las im\u00e1genes se vean muy n\u00edtidas.2)La c\u00e1mara y el video no tienen nada que envidiarle a un artefacto dedicado es decir a una c\u00e1mara digital o a una videocamara, las fotos son muy bien logradas y el flash realmente funciona en lugares oscuras se pueden apreciar perfectamente los detalles.3) La conexi\u00f3n a Internet es muy buena, gracias al zoom puedes agrandar o disminuir la im\u00e1genes las cuales se aprecian muy bien, logicamente hay p\u00e1ginas que por ser tan grandes no se observaran como en la computadora, pero en realidad la navegaci\u00f3n es placentera siempre y cuando no tengas que estar digitando algo.4) Conectarte a las redes sociales o a tu correo electr\u00f3nico esta a un click de distancia y como dige antes en segundos y puedes leer archivos en formato de word excel o PDF. Es decir si no estas cerca a de una computadora no hay ning\u00fan problema te sacar\u00e1 del apuro, aunque repito la experiencia aun no es como con la computadora pero ese es un problema en todos los tel\u00e9fono inteligentes. Yo reviso mis estados de cuenta, puedo hacer una compra en Amazon pagar recibos entrar al banco hacer transacciones, etc, etc.5) El tel\u00e9fono es robusto se ve fuerte aunque aun no se ha llevado ning\u00fan golpe6) Tiene todas las funciones de los tel\u00e9fonos convencionales pero a diferencia de otros estas realmente cumplen por ejemplo si tienes una grabadora tu esperas que cuando des click esta realmente grabe y esta lo hace, yo he tenido telefonos que cuando quise usar la grabadora esta simplemente no funcion\u00f3. Puedes vivar con ello pero da c\u00f3lera que una aplicaci\u00f3n no funcione como debiera.Pero bueno no todo es perfecto y lo que no me gust\u00f3 es lo inc\u00f3modo que resulta a veces el teclado qwerty a veces cuando estoy navegando si por alguna raz\u00f3n tengo que digitar algo puedo desplegar texto en pantalla pero en otras ocasiones esta caracter\u00edstica no esta disponible y me obliga a usar el teclado y no se si es la falta de costumbre pero soy mucho mas diestro con las teclas de un tel\u00e9fono que con este tipo de teclado y me demoro mucho por lo que me resulta engorroso. Pero bueno no se talvez dentro de unos meses ya me halla acostumbrado.Pero por lo dem\u00e1s creo que son mucho mas las satisfacciones imaginense pueden utilizar este tel\u00e9fono como un GPS yo en la particular no lo uso por que ya tengo un Garmin que es una belleza y al cual ya estoy super acostumbrado pero bueno esta es una aplicaci\u00f3n que bien vale la pena utilizar si esta disponible. En sintes\u00eds le digo comprelo no se va a arrepentir, a y se me olvidaba la pantalla t\u00e1ctil funciona a las mil maravillas esta era una de mis principales dudas, pero me di cuenta que si funciona y excelentemente bien, el secreto es calibrarla la pantalla a tu gusto, si gustas de apretar mucho el l\u00e1piz pues as\u00ed la calibras a mi me gustan los trazos suaves y as\u00ed la calibr\u00e9 y apenas dejo caer el l\u00e1piz y la funci\u00f3n se aplica. As\u00ed es que es una buena inversi\u00f3n la \u00fanica raz\u00f3n por la que no le d\u00ed cinco estrellas fue por la raz\u00f3n del teclado por lo dem\u00e1s no hay quejas."

Once the reception is lost, it could take a minute or more for you to be able to see some signal bars appeared again. Second, the connection is another issue for this cell phone. It gives a lot of \"connection error\" messages, and I have experienced way more call drops since I changed to this cell phone. Also, the home screen rotates easily from vertical to horizontal, but it doesn't do the same backward. I have to shake the phone with some strength for the home screen rotate back to vertical. Overall, I am very disappointed with Nokia N97, but since I paid a good amount of money for it, I have to stick with it for a while."

The Ovi Store is a great app store that allows you to download apps, themes, and other content for your Nokia phone safely. I would not recommend installing any apps that are not through the Ovi Store. I did and ended up having to reset my phone, losing some of the content that came originally on the phone. Great phone, though. Only drawback I have noticed is that depending on how you hold the phone, sometimes your voice comes across muffled to the person you are on the phone with."

This is a exquisite piece of hardware, the feel of the device is the nicest of any phone I have owned. But the software is really showing its age, even compared to newer, cheaper Nokia phones.Nokia really are asleep at the wheel, the 5530 shows they can do reasonable job of making a touch phone using S60 but they have let their S60 flagship lag far behind other S60 phones that are less than half the price. I gave both the 5800 navigation edition and the 5530 XpressMusic 5 stars based on the great usability and incredible value, but the wonderful N97 hardware is let down by old software.Good:- Wonderful hardware.- Excellent call quality- Very extensive feature set.- Very nice screen in sunlight.- White color looks great.- Nice keyboard (except space bar).- 32GB internal storage.Bad:- Home screen lacks scrolling contacts of 5530.- Inconsistent touch menu (some double, some single tap).- Very small space bar.- Mediocre browser.- Weak FM transmitter (not powerful enough for car use).- Ovi Maps lack search (you need to have google maps installed too).- No in-line spell check.Don't even waste your time comparing this phone to true smartphones like nexusone, droid or iphone 3gs, its just not in that league software wise, only price wise. When you see what google and apple have done so early in the smartphone game, it really is a shame for Nokia. Such great hardware let down by such bad software. And before you say N900, I had one and returned it, maemo shows promise but is far from ready for primetime use and the hardware is a brick.If you have lots of money, already like Nokia S60 phones and have never used an iphone or droid you should love this phone. Everyone else steer clear of it, looks at the 5800 or 5530 if you wanna go Nokia."

        "comment": "The phone is very clean looking and I loved the keyboard and everything. However, the OS of this phone is old-school looking, and I didn't like that I had to use my nail to select things on the phone. I was use to the iPhone where you use your actual finger. The phone does let you use your fingers, but you end up choosing stuff that is above, below, or next to it. They give you an option to buy a stylus, but why do you HAVE to get a stylus to get better performance from the phone?There were also quite a few buggy problems that I had with the phone, but not serious enough to handicap the phone. This is a nice phone if you don't care about specifics and just need a phone to do basic things on.The camera I didn't feel was as awesome as they keep advertising. The quality was good enough but that's it. Not a huge WOW factor. Video was the same. Then again it is a phone, not a digital camera. I didn't like how I would turn off the flash of the phone and the light still went off when I took the picture (hard to be discreet).Overall, I think the phone was okay, had more cons than pros in my opinion."

        "comment": "This phone and the Nokia service are superb. After the V2.0 Firmware update the phone runs smooth and fast. All the issues i was complaining about when I got it got improved and now it is a perfect phone. The keyboard is good the screen with kinetic scrolling are nice and the homescreen is not only good-looking but also very user-friendly. With 32 GB you can leave your mp3 player at home. It comes with a 3.5mm headphone clinch so you can use your normal headphones.I needed to send it already to repair because i dropped it really hard on the floor. The phone wouldn't switch on anymore and the slider was damaged, too. I send it for repair hoping not to pay anything. I waited a week for a email and actually wanted to call already but then the phone arrived without send me even an email. One week, inclusive shipping! The most impressive part was that they didn't just make it work again, but they also corrected all cosmetic damage. I didn't get a bill or anything. I was really surprised and that is a major + for this phone.I have to take off one point of this phone because of the Ovi Store. Most apps are ''light'' or you have to pay. There are actually very few apps only available. Most of the Ovi stuff are wallpapers and really bad ringtones. They have to really improve that store.My conclusionN97+appstore=the perfect phone. It is still an iphone killer i would say. If you're not to main stream and like phones nobody really has. Go with this. It's nice"

        "comment": "I never thought I would hate a piece of technology, but the N97 phone changed everything. The N97 was a big disappointment from the very first moment of handling it. The battery cover refused to go on. After thirty minutes of failing and sore fingers, I started reading the manual. For god's sake, I shouldn't need to read the manual to put on a battery cover! The manual was of no help and I began to be violent with it until it was forced on. It has been downhill from there.The N97 is of an exceptional poor design; It looks common from the outside, and is garbage on the inside. Let me review each main function separately:1. Voice: The phone is awkward to hold and speak. The addition of a keyboard really makes it heavy and fat.2. Contacts: This is the WORST aspect of this phone. The phone RANDOMLY chooses when to display an incoming caller Id! All you get is a phone number, and good luck trying to remember which phone number belonged to whom in your contacts. I have had this phone for 5 months now and I still do not know how to fix this major issue. At first, I thought I needed to transfer all the SIM card contacts to the phone's memory contacts, but this did not work.3. Keyboard: The keyboard is not practical. You have to use shift keys for numbers and symbols. A shift key for a period or a colon. A shift key for a smiley face. A terrible Idea.4. Web: The web browser is slower than death, and unresponsive. At one point I almost cracked the screen while surfing from all the frustration. Once you access a web page it is another task to scroll down or sideways.5. GPS: if you are in a pickle or driving and need some quick help finding your way, then don't even consider the N97 as an option. The GPS does not lock onto a signal quickly, it takes the phone a minimum of 15 min to find a signal, and one time it took me 45 min!6. Applications: No good apps. There are applications for facebook, twitter and myspace. However, they are not enjoyable to use. If you have your N97 while among a group of iphone users you will be ashamed to show it off. You look at all those apple users play and laugh about the cool apps they have on their phone, while I am still wondering who is calling me, because this phone can't display the name from the contacts.7. Camera: the photos are OK, not great thought. The flash is a big waste of power, it gives those being pictured a sickly jaundiced look.I urge all who see this to NOT buy this phone, and to tell all their loved ones not to as well. I on the other hand am cursed with this abomination, this travesty of dysform and dysfunction, until I can afford another phone."

The only thing I miss are better PIM tools. When registering a new contact, it is not easy to access address data as well. As a rule of thumb, it's to-do and memo notes are less intuitive than Palm applications. Aside form that, again a magnificent piece of hardware."

It feels solid in the hand and the screen is bright/gorgeous.The processor is lightning fast, hit about 91k in Antutu benchmarks.Cameras are solid, both front/back.Battery life is GOOD, about 4-6 continuous use or 10-12 hours of on/off use.Bluetooth is weak, same as Honor 5x - my bluetooth headset would crackle and loose connection when I would put the phone in my back pocket.GPS is spoty - sometimes it would think I'm 10 blocks away (same as the Honor 5x)The fingerprint reader is awesome - it doubles as a BUTTON and can be programmed to do several things (1 press turns on flashlight, 2 presses turn on camera, etc.)Compared to my iPhone 6s, I prefer the feel and look of the Honor 8, but for around the same price you can now get an iPhone 6S which is more powerful & reliable."

I opted to check out what was being offered for last year's iPhone on Amazon and found a reasonably priced slightly used iPhone 4 with a great deal of memory. The device works as expected, no blemishes (at least none that I could find and I think there was mention of typical minor wear and tear - I saw none but I think that has to be put out there for used/refurb devices) and all cords, chargers were included in packaging. It was delivered early and my son is thoroughly pleased to go from a free Samsung smartphone to an iPhone 4 (granted he wanted the 5 but he's 15 - he'll live...besides he's happy to be at the same level his friends are at with their phones). I will be purchasing my phone this way and going outside of Verizon's market from now on. This seller is outstanding, the service and quality easily exceeds expectations. Thoroughly pleased!!!!"

Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is \"new\" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star."

I researched several phones and just needed something simple and I admit I loved the phone, but sadly I got attached just when it turned off twice in a week and on the last time, I gave up and returned it, fortunately I did get refunded."

It's pretty huge but the phone could actually fit in your pocket (a good size deep pocket). 2 drawbacks are: Sound could be louder when playing music from the phone's music app and 2nd, camera could be better...but in regards to the latter statement, I believe you can download any type of camera u want and use the downloaded camera for photos instead of the default camera."

I had a simple hard rubber case and screen protectors that helped it remain in mint condition, though being dropped constantly. Despite the camera flash only working sporadically after the phone updated itself, it is very reliable has excellent cameras Great HD. I recomend turning the phone off once a day. It can keep tons of apps running in the background and still stream HD vids and take calls without an act of congress. Everything runs the way people with I-phones wish their phones would work. ***Also Tmobile has *4 gigs of *4g speed with *no contract and *unlimited texts for * $30.00 a month and has download speeds of 8mb per second on average. Don't be a sucker. Since the plan only has 100 anytime minutes it may be necessary to get a simple unlimited talk phone for 20 a month, essentially having 2 phones with unlimited everything for 50 per month with no tax. LOL. And but the best 4G internet there is (Having tried Sprints \"Unlimited Data where they throtlle the hell out of your ass and knowing the evil ways of Verizon, I try not to reward there scumbaggedry).

It differentiates between the accounts in your contact list by color and provides you the ability to set a default account but still operate from the other for individual actions if you would like. The one down side is it is not a smart phone so for a guy who is used to the 'swiping' function for texting on my Samsung, using this type of phone for texts is a bit of a drag--but that is not the phone's fault. The battery life is great on this--I only have to charge it about once a week (I am not on it much though--if I was calling or texting more that would probably not hold true). No games or other fun features, but if all you are looking for is a dual account phone, this is a great option--especially for the price. I have used it in Europe and in Africa. No issues or worries."

Unfortunately, the microphone was not functional, so basically it is only good for texting. Also, the prior owner's phone numbers were still on the built-in SIM card so that was kind of weird. Not sure what to make of it and I'm sure every one of these for sale will be different, but our experience wasn't so great."

You may not if you're using it for a wifi connection or voice all day. The fact that the battery is so easily replaceable is HUGE for me. I just carry an extra battery in my backpack. When the battery is low I can simply swap it. Best possible option for me. I've never that guy at the airport running around looking for power like iPhone owners.Cover: This is different from any other phone: the case IS the cover. So when you buy a new case you're replacing the entire cover of the phone. So your case doesn't need to fit over the factory case - it replaces it. Very nice design. So many nice cases available for this phone. I have a leather case that gets compliments all the time.OS: I think you either like Windows Phone OS or you don't. Very intuitive to me. Does what I expect it to when I expect it to. I like the tiled navigation page. So easy to rearrange and resize tiles.The only issues I can see with this and other Windows phones is the lack of software support. Waze, for example is fairly crippled on Windows vs. Android. All the other apps I need are there. But clearly far fewer apps than Android and iPhones have. Not an issue for me."

The reason for three stars is only because the phone is an older model, so the verizon backup wouldn't work on this phone, I had to take it to a verizon store and have a technician download all my husband's information for me. Other than that, it is a great phone"

It is a great value for someone who has to bring their own phone. It looks nice, it's much lighter than other phones but the metal case makes it look pricier. It's location makes perfect sense. When I bought it (in the beginning of the year) I spent hours reading reviews and watching reviews. It was one of the best rated in March 2016 for it's price range. I have not been disappointed."
